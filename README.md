# 💻 Hey there, I'm Mitesh

### 🌟 Data Whisperer | Big Data Adventurer ☁️

Welcome to my GitHub corner! If you’re into **data**, **cloud-native architectures**, and **real-time stream processing**, you’re in the right place. I spend my days (and sometimes nights) building scalable data systems, tweaking pipelines, and convincing cloud services to behave. 🙃

### 🚀 A Bit About Me

By day, I work magic on **data pipelines**, helping organizations make sense of their chaos and turn it into actionable insights. By night, I’m likely orchestrating complex data workflows with **Apache Airflow** or debugging yet another **Kafka** stream (they keep me on my toes).

### 🔧 Skills & Technologies
I’m fluent in the languages of data (and by that, I mean both **SQL** and **Scala**). My toolbox includes:
- **Languages**: Python, SQL, Scala
- **Data Processing**: Apache Spark, Databricks, Apache Kafka
- **Data Storage**: Data Lake, MySQL, MongoDB
- **Data Warehousing**: Snowflake ❄️, Azure Synapse Analytics
- **Visualization**: Power BI (because pretty charts make everything better!)

### 🗂️ What You’ll Find Here
Here, you'll find my collection of **weekend projects** — yes, I love to spend my weekends crafting solutions for **data challenges** and putting new tools to the test. Sometimes it’s about **real-time analytics**, sometimes tinkering randomly — there’s always something cooking! 🍳
